# freedom_io_board

The Freedom IO Board is currently under development.  
It is an electronics development debugging tool that provides a significant
amount of output with a limited amount of IO.


The board specs are:
 - 8 7-segment displays, enough to display the contents of a 32-bit word.
 - 32 LED/3.3 V outputs
 - 12 Buttons
 - 16 Switches with LEDs
 - 2 Rotary Encoders
 - 2.3-12V Aux power input
 - Spare ground tie-point
 - Extra power header for additional boards
 - Rubber feet for isolation
 - All controlled via I2C - only two GPIO are needed for control!
